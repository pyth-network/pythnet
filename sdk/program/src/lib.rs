//! The base library for all Solana on-chain Rust programs.
//!
//! All Solana Rust programs that run on-chain will link to this crate, which
//! acts as a standard library for Solana programs. Solana programs also link to
//! the [Rust standard library][std], though it is [modified][sstd] for the
//! Solana runtime environment. While off-chain programs that interact with the
//! Solana network _can_ link to this crate, they typically instead use the
//! [`solana-sdk`] crate, which reexports all modules from `solana-program`.

//!
//! # Defining a solana program
//!
//! Solana program crates have some unique properties compared to typical Rust
//! programs:
//!
//! - They are often compiled for both on-chain use and off-chain use. This is
//!   primarily because off-chain clients may need access to data types
//!   defined by the on-chain program.
//! - They do not define a `main` function, but instead define their entrypoint
//!   with the [`entrypoint!`] macro.
//! - They are compiled as the ["cdylib"] crate type for dynamic loading
//!   by the Solana runtime.
//! - They run in a constrained VM environment, and while they do have access to
//!   the [Rust standard library][std], many features of the standard library,
//!   particularly related to OS services, will fail at runtime, will silently
//!   do nothing, or are not defined. See the [restrictions to the Rust standard
//!   library][sstd] in the Solana documentation for more.
//!
//! [std]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html
//! ["cdylib"]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html
//!
//! Because multiple crates that are linked together cannot all define
//! program entrypoints (see the [`entrypoint!`] documentation) a common
//! convention is to use a [Cargo feature] called `no-entrypoint` to allow
//! the program entrypoint to be disabled.
//!
//! [Cargo feature]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html
//!
//! The skeleton of a Solana program typically looks like:
//!
//! ```
//! #[cfg(not(feature = "no-entrypoint"))]
//! pub mod entrypoint {
//!     use solana_program::{
//!         account_info::AccountInfo,
//!         entrypoint,
//!         entrypoint::ProgramResult,
//!         pubkey::Pubkey,
//!     };
//!
//!     entrypoint!(process_instruction);
//!
//!     pub fn process_instruction(
//!         program_id: &Pubkey,
//!         accounts: &[AccountInfo],
//!         instruction_data: &[u8],
//!     ) -> ProgramResult {
//!         // Decode and dispatch instructions here.
//!         todo!()
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // Additional code goes here.
//! ```
//!
//! With a `Cargo.toml` file that contains
//!
//! ```toml
//! [lib]
//! crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
//!
//! [features]
//! no-entrypoint = []
//! ```
//!
//! Note that a Solana program must specify its crate-type as "cdylib", and
//! "cdylib" crates will automatically be discovered and built by the `cargo
//! build-bpf` command. Solana programs also often have crate-type "rlib" so
//! they can be linked to other Rust crates.
//!
//! # On-chain vs. off-chain compilation targets
//!
//! Solana programs run on the [rbpf] VM, which implements a variant of the
//! [eBPF] instruction set. Because this crate can be compiled for both on-chain
//! and off-chain execution, the environments of which are significantly
//! different, it extensively uses [conditional compilation][cc] to tailor its
//! implementation to the environment. The `cfg` predicate used for identifying
//! compilation for on-chain programs is `target_arch = "bpf"`, as in this
//! example from the `solana-program` codebase that logs a message via a
//! syscall when run on-chain, and via a library call when offchain:
//!
//! [rbpf]: https://github.com/solana-labs/rbpf
//! [eBPF]: https://ebpf.io/
//! [cc]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html
//!
//! ```
//! pub fn sol_log(message: &str) {
//!     #[cfg(target_arch = "bpf")]
//!     unsafe {
//!         sol_log_(message.as_ptr(), message.len() as u64);
//!     }
//!
//!     #[cfg(not(target_arch = "bpf"))]
//!     program_stubs::sol_log(message);
//! }
//! # mod program_stubs {
//! #     pub(crate) fn sol_log(message: &str) { }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! This `cfg` pattern is suitable as well for user code that needs to work both
//! on-chain and off-chain.
//!
//! `solana-program` and `solana-sdk` were previously a single crate. Because of
//! this history, and because of the dual-usage of `solana-program` for two
//! different environments, it contains some features that are not available to
//! on-chain programs at compile-time. It also contains some on-chain features
//! that will fail in off-chain scenarios at runtime. This distinction is not
//! well-reflected in the documentation.
//!
//! For a more complete description of Solana's implementation of eBPF and its
//! limitations, see the main Solana documentation for [on-chain programs][ocp].
//!
//! [ocp]: https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/overview
//!
//! # Core data types
//!
//! - [`Pubkey`] &mdash; The address of a [Solana account][acc]. Some account
//!   addresses are [ed25519] public keys, with corresponding secret keys that
//!   are managed off-chain. Often though account addresses do not have
//!   corresponding secret keys, as with [_program derived addresses_][pdas], or
//!   the secret key is not relevant to the operation of a program, and may have
//!   even been disposed of. As running Solana programs can not safely create or
//!   manage secret keys, the full [`Keypair`] is not defined in
//!   `solana-program` but in `solana-sdk`.
//! - [`Hash`] &mdash; A [SHA-256] hash. Used to uniquely identify blocks, and
//!   also for general purpose hashing.
//! - [`AccountInfo`] &mdash; A description of a single Solana account. All accounts
//!   that might be accessed by a program invocation are provided to the program
//!   entrypoint as `AccountInfo`.
//! - [`Instruction`] &mdash; A directive telling the runtime to execute a program,
//!   passing it a set of accounts and program-specific data.
//! - [`ProgramError`] and [`ProgramResult`] &mdash; The error type that all programs
//!   must return, reported to the runtime as a `u64`.
//! - [`Sol`] &mdash; The Solana native token type, with conversions to and from
//!   [_lamports_], the smallest fractional unit of SOL, in the [`native_token`]
//!   module.

//!
//! # Serialization
//!
//! Within the Solana runtime, programs, and network, at least three different
//! serialization formats are used, and `solana-program` provides access to
//! those needed by programs.
//!
//! In user-written Solana program code, serialization is primarily used for
//! accessing [`AccountInfo`] data and [`Instruction`] data, both of which are
//! program-specific binary data. Every program is free to decide their own
//! serialization format, but data recieved from other sources &mdash;
//! [sysvars][sysvar] for example &mdash; must be deserialized using the methods
//! indicated by the documentation for that data or data type.
//!
//! [`AccountInfo`]: account_info::AccountInfo
//! [`Instruction`]: instruction::Instruction
//!
//! The three serialization formats in use in Solana are:
//!
//! - __[Borsh]__, a compact and well-specified format developed by the [NEAR]
//!   project, suitable for use in protocol definitions and for archival storage.
//!   It has a [Rust implementation][brust] and a [JavaScript implementation][bjs]
//!   and is recommended for all purposes.
//!
//!   Users need to import the [`borsh`] crate themselves &mdash; it is not
//!   re-exported by `solana-program`, though this crate provides several useful
//!   utilities in its [`borsh` module][borshmod] that are not available in the
//!   `borsh` library.
//!
//!   The [`Instruction::new_with_borsh`] function creates an `Instruction` by
//!   serializing a value with borsh.
//!
//!   [Borsh]: https://borsh.io/
//!   [NEAR]: https://near.org/
//!   [brust]: https://docs.rs/borsh
//!   [bjs]: https://github.com/near/borsh-js
//!   [`borsh`]: https://docs.rs/borsh
//!   [borshmod]: crate::borsh
//!   [`Instruction::new_with_borsh`]: instruction::Instruction::new_with_borsh
//!
//! - __[Bincode]__, a compact serialization format that implements the [Serde]
//!   Rust APIs. As it does not have a specification nor a JavaScript
//!   implementation, and uses more CPU than borsh, it is not recommend for new
//!   code.
//!
//!   Many system program and native program instructions are serialized with
//!   bincode, and it is used for other purposes in the runtime. In these cases
//!   Rust programmers are generally not directly exposed to the encoding format
//!   as it is hidden behind APIs.
//!
//!   The [`Instruction::new_with_bincode`] function creates an `Instruction` by
//!   serializing a value with bincode.
//!
//!   [Bincode]: https://docs.rs/bincode
//!   [Serde]: https://serde.rs/
//!   [`Instruction::new_with_bincode`]: instruction::Instruction::new_with_bincode
//!
//! - __[`Pack`]__, a Solana-specific serialization API that is used by many
//!   older programs in the [Solana Program Library][spl] to define their
//!   account format. It is difficult to implement and does not define a
//!   language-independent serialization format. It is not generally recommended
//!   for new code.
//!
//!   [`Pack`]: program_pack::Pack
//!
//! Developers should carefully consider the CPU cost of serialization, balanced
//! against the need for correctness and ease of use: off-the-shelf
//! serialization formats tend to be more expensive than carefully hand-written
//! application-specific formats; but application-specific formats are more
//! difficult to ensure the correctness of, and to provide multi-language
//! implementations for. It is not uncommon for programs to pack and unpack
//! their data with hand-written code.
//!
//! # Cross-program instruction execution
//!
//! Solana programs may call other programs, termed [_cross-program
//! invocation_][cpi] (CPI), with the [`invoke`] and [`invoke_signed`]
//! functions. When calling another program the caller must provide the
//! [`Instruction`] to be invoked, as well as the [`AccountInfo`] for every
//! account required by the instruction. Because the only way for a program to
//! acquire `AccountInfo` values is by receiving them from the runtime at the
//! [program entrypoint][entrypoint!], any account required by the callee
//! program must transitively be required by the caller program, and provided by
//! _its_ caller.
//!
//! [`invoke`]: program::invoke
//! [`invoke_signed`]: program::invoke_signed
//! [cpi]: https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs
//!
//! A simple example of transferring lamports via CPI:
//!
//! ```
//! use solana_program::{
//!     account_info::{next_account_info, AccountInfo},
//!     entrypoint,
//!     entrypoint::ProgramResult,
//!     program::invoke,
//!     pubkey::Pubkey,
//!     system_instruction,
//!     system_program,
//! };
//!
//! entrypoint!(process_instruction);
//!
//! fn process_instruction(
//!     program_id: &Pubkey,
//!     accounts: &[AccountInfo],
//!     instruction_data: &[u8],
//! ) -> ProgramResult {
//!     let account_info_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
//!
//!     let payer = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
//!     let recipient = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
//!     // The system program is a required account to invoke a system
//!     // instruction, even though we don't use it directly.
//!     let system_account = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
//!
//!     assert!(payer.is_writable);
//!     assert!(payer.is_signer);
//!     assert!(recipient.is_writable);
//!     assert!(system_program::check_id(system_account.key));
//!
//!     let lamports = 1000000;
//!
//!     invoke(
//!         &system_instruction::transfer(payer.key, recipient.key, lamports),
//!         &[payer.clone(), recipient.clone(), system_account.clone()],
//!     )
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Solana also includes a mechinasm to let programs control and sign for
//! accounts without needing to protect a corresponding secret key, called
//! [_program derived addresses_][pdas]. PDAs are derived with the
//! [`Pubkey::find_program_address`] function. With a PDA, a program can call
//! `invoke_signed` to call another program while virtually "signing" for the
//! PDA.
//!

//! A simple example of creating an account for a PDA:
//!
//! ```
//! use solana_program::{
//!     account_info::{next_account_info, AccountInfo},
//!     entrypoint,
//!     entrypoint::ProgramResult,
//!     program::invoke_signed,
//!     pubkey::Pubkey,
//!     system_instruction,

//! };
//!
//! entrypoint!(process_instruction);
//!
//! fn process_instruction(

//!     let payer = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
//!     let vault_pda = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;

//!             ],
//!         ]
//!     )?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Native programs
//!
//! Some solana programs are [_native programs_][np2], running native machine
//! code that is distributed with the runtime, with well-known program IDs.
//!
//! [np2]: https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs
//!
//! Some native programs can be [invoked][cpi] by other programs, but some can
//! only be executed as "top-level" instructions included by off-chain clients
//! in a [`Transaction`].
//!
//! [`Transaction`]: https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/latest/solana_sdk/transaction/struct.Transaction.html
//!
//! This crate defines the program IDs for most native programs. Even though
//! some native programs cannot be invoked by other programs, a Solana program
//! may need access to their program IDs. For example, a program may need to
//! verify that an ed25519 signature verification instruction was included in
//! the same transaction as its own instruction. For many native programs, this
//! crate also defines enums that represent the instructions they process, and
//! constructors for building the instructions.
//!
//! Locations of program IDs and instruction constructors are noted in the list
//! below, as well as whether they are invokable by other programs.
//!
//! While some native programs have been active since the genesis block, others
//! are activated dynamically after a specific [slot], and some are not yet
//! active. This documentation does not distinguish which native programs are
//! active on any particular network. The `solana feature status` CLI command
//! can help in determining active features.
//!
//! [slot]: https://docs.solana.com/terminology#slot
//!
//! Native programs important to Solana program authors include:
//!
//! - __System Program__: Creates new accounts, allocates account data, assigns
//!   accounts to owning programs, transfers lamports from System Program owned
//!   accounts and pays transaction fees.

//!
//! # Sysvars
//!
//! Sysvars are special accounts that contain dynamically-updated data about
//! the network cluster, the blockchain history, and the executing transaction.
//!
//! The program IDs for sysvars are defined in the [`sysvar`] module, and simple
//! sysvars implement the [`Sysvar::get`] method, which loads a sysvar directly
//! from the runtime, as in this example that logs the `clock` sysvar:
//!
//! [`Sysvar::get`]: sysvar::Sysvar::get
//!
//! ```
//! use solana_program::{
//!     account_info::AccountInfo,
//!     clock,
//!     entrypoint::ProgramResult,
//!     msg,
//!     pubkey::Pubkey,
//!     sysvar::Sysvar,
//! };
//!
//! fn process_instruction(
//!     program_id: &Pubkey,
//!     accounts: &[AccountInfo],
//!     instruction_data: &[u8],
//! ) -> ProgramResult {
//!     let clock = clock::Clock::get()?;
//!     msg!("clock: {:#?}", clock);
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Since Solana sysvars are accounts, if the `AccountInfo` is provided to the
//! program, then the program can deserialize the sysvar with
//! [`Sysvar::from_account_info`] to access its data, as in this example that
//! again logs the [`clock`][clk] sysvar.
//!
//! [`Sysvar::from_account_info`]: sysvar::Sysvar::from_account_info
//! [clk]: sysvar::clock
//!
//! ```
//! use solana_program::{
//!     account_info::{next_account_info, AccountInfo},
//!     clock,
//!     entrypoint::ProgramResult,
//!     msg,
//!     pubkey::Pubkey,
//!     sysvar::Sysvar,
//! };
//!
//! fn process_instruction(
//!     program_id: &Pubkey,
//!     accounts: &[AccountInfo],
//!     instruction_data: &[u8],
//! ) -> ProgramResult {
//!     let account_info_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
//!     let clock_account = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
//!     let clock = clock::Clock::from_account_info(&clock_account)?;
//!     msg!("clock: {:#?}", clock);
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! When possible, programs should prefer to call `Sysvar::get` instead of
//! deserializing with `Sysvar::from_account_info`, as the latter imposes extra
//! overhead of deserialization while also requiring the sysvar account address
//! be passed to the program, wasting the limited space available to
//! transactions. Deserializing sysvars that can instead be retrieved with
//! `Sysvar::get` should be only be considered for compatibility with older
//! programs that pass around sysvar accounts.
//!
//! Some sysvars are too large to deserialize within a program, and
//! `Sysvar::from_account_info` returns an error. Some sysvars are too large
//! to deserialize within a program, and attempting to will exhaust the
//! program's compute budget. Some sysvars do not implement `Sysvar::get` and
//! return an error. Some sysvars have custom deserializers that do not
//! implement the `Sysvar` trait. These cases are documented in the modules for
//! individual sysvars.
//!
//! For more details see the Solana [documentation on sysvars][sysvardoc].
